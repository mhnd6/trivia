# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Trivia web app is an application where you can take quizzes in different categories. You can add questions and delete them, and finally search for questions.

The application can:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
